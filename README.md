### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced Psychologist and child-development professional with over 2 years of proven expertise in child psychology and behavioral intervention. 


With skills in developmental assessment, team leadership, family counseling, and cross-functional collaboration, I am able to support children’s emotional, social, and cognitive growth and achieve meaningful developmental progress. I am adept at using standardized child assessment tools, computer programming, and Excel Spreadsheets. 


My versatile skill set, commitment to excellence, and passion for improvement make me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to read and photograph my adventures.

### Projects

#### Project 1 Title
 - This project is an Excel-based profit and pricing analysis tool that calculates profit, evaluates margins, suggests price adjustments, uses VLOOKUP for automation, and displays revenue and profit trends through dynamic graphs.
 - !images/portfolio project 1.jpg
 - Initial project ideas:
The idea for this project came from the need to analyze product performance efficiently and decide whether prices should be adjusted to increase profitability. Many businesses track revenue and profit manually, which can lead to errors and make it difficult to compare product sets or identify trends. I wanted to build a spreadsheet that automatically calculates profit, evaluates whether the profit margin meets target levels, and adjusts prices when needed

Tools:
Microsoft Excel is the core platform
Formulas including VLOOKUP, IF, percentage calculations, and basic arithmetic for revenue and profit
Conditional formatting to flag products needing price increases
Data validation to ensure clean and consistent input
Line and column charts to visually display revenue and profit trends
Cell protection to prevent accidental formula changes

Challenges:
One major challenge was structuring the spreadsheet so that it remained flexible enough to handle different product sets and price structures while keeping formulas accurate. Setting up VLOOKUP tables required careful organization to ensure values were correctly referenced. Another challenge involved determining the criteria for when a profit margin should be increased and designing clear formulas to automate this decision.

Other Resources:
I used online tutorials to review VLOOKUP variations, chart formatting, and conditional logic. Although I developed the spreadsheet independently, I referenced sample dashboards for data organization.

Results:
I set out to build a complete profit and pricing analysis tool that could calculate revenue, determine profit margins, recommend price adjustments, and display trends visually, and I successfully achieved this goal. The spreadsheet automatically calculates profit, identifies products below the desired margin, suggests adjusted prices, and includes clear, informative graphs for both revenue and profit. If I were to expand the project, I would add forecasting tools, scenario analysis options, and more advanced functions for deeper insights.

#### Excel Grade Calculator
 - This project is an Excel-based grade calculator designed to simplify tracking academic performance. It uses formulas, formatting, and automated calculations to help users understand current grades and predict future outcomes
 - images/portfolio project 2.jpg
 - Initial Project Idea:
The idea for this project came from noticing how many students struggle to track their grades throughout a course, especially when assignments carry different weights. I wanted to create a tool that made it easier to calculate current grades, predict final grades, and understand how individual assignments impact overall performance. The problem needed solving because students often rely on guessing or manual calculations, which can be time-consuming and inaccurate. A simple Excel spreadsheet could automate the math and give clear, instant feedback.

Tools:
Microsoft Excel as the primary platform
Formulas such as AVERAGE, SUM, IF, and weighted calculations
Cell formatting for clarity and ease of use

Challenges Faced:
One challenge was determining the best formula structure for weighted grading because different classes use different systems. I had to experiment with formulas to ensure they could be easily adapted. Another challenge was organizing the spreadsheet so that it was user-friendly, visually clear, and protected from accidental edits in formula cells.


Other resources:
I used Excel’s built-in help guides to review the syntax for complex formulas like nested IF statements. I did not collaborate with anyone directly, but I looked at examples on layout and formatting ideas. All formulas and design elements in the final spreadsheet were created independently

Results:
I set out to create a functional, accurate, and easy-to-use grade calculator that could help students monitor their progress throughout a course, and I successfully achieved this. The spreadsheet correctly handles weighted categories, automatically updates final grades, and allows users to test “what-if” scenarios for future assignments. If I were to continue improving this project, I would add drop-down menus for customizable grading systems

#### Python Personality Test
 - This project is a Python-based personality test that uses user responses to generate a personality profile. It demonstrates input handling, scoring logic, and structured decision-making while providing a fun, interactive experience.
 - images/portfolio project 3.jpg
 - Initial Project idea:
I developed this project on the idea that many people enjoy quick, interactive personality tests but often rely on online versions that are not customizable or transparent about how results are generated. I wanted to create a program that lets users answer simple questions and receive an immediate personality profile based on their responses. The goal was to design a fun, user-centered tool that demonstrates how logic, scoring systems, and decision structures work in Python. This problem mattered because personality tests can be useful for self-reflection, stress awareness, and even improving communication styles—and building one from scratch allowed full control over how the assessment works.

Tools I used:
Python 2 is the main programming language
IDLE / VS Code for writing and testing code
Conditional statements, loops, lists, and dictionaries to structure the quiz
Basic scoring algorithms to generate personality categories

Challenges I faced:
One of the first challenges I encountered was deciding how to score responses in a way that felt accurate and meaningful. I had to design a scoring system that mapped user choices to consistent personality types. Another challenge was structuring the program so that it remained simple for the user but flexible in the code. I also worked through issues with input validation, making sure the program handles unexpected answers without crashing. Through testing, debugging, and reorganizing my code, I overcame these obstacles and improved the test’s flow


Other resources:
I used basic tutorials and videos to review concepts such as conditionals and loops. I did not directly collaborate with anyone, but I reviewed various examples of quiz-style programs for general inspiration on formatting and structure. All code in the final project was written independently

Results:
I set out to create an interactive personality test that assigns a personality category based on user responses, and I successfully achieved this goal. The program runs smoothly, provides immediate results, and can easily be expanded with more questions or more detailed personality descriptions. If I were to continue developing this project, I would add a graphical interface, store user results, and include more advanced logic such as weighted scoring or branching question paths

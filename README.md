### About Me 
Hello! I am an experienced Psychologist and child-development professional with over 2 years of proven expertise in child psychology and behavioral intervention. 


With skills in developmental assessment, team leadership, family counseling, and cross-functional collaboration, I am able to support children’s emotional, social, and cognitive growth and achieve meaningful developmental progress. I am adept at using standardized child assessment tools, computer programming, and Excel Spreadsheets. 


My versatile skill set, commitment to excellence, and passion for improvement make me a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to read and photograph my adventures.
